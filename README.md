ferMatha is a blog I'm developing where I share some cool insights into the intersection of music and mathematics. It's currently a work in progress and will be deployed soon as a MERN blog. 
You can check a beta/protoype version of the blog here through this link: [seank04.github.io/ferMatha/](https://seank04.github.io/ferMatha/).
