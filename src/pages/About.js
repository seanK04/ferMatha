            <p>Hi, I'm Sean and I attend Brown University in Providence, RI. Music and
                math have been some of my passions for years, and I
                share some cool insights into where they intersect in this blog. Huge
                shoutout to my boy Chris for inspiring me to start this blog.
                You can check out his blog <a href="https://chrissuu.github.io/bleu/about/">here</a>.
